A collection of some java programs.

The library management system is built with mySQL and eclipse. The MVC pattern is used with a domain layer, a data-access object layer (dao), a service layer, and a menu layer.
The domain layer contains the information for each table and methods to retrieve and update attributes. The dao layer is the only layer that communicates with the database.

The user can perform different operations on the database from the command line.
A borrower can see which books are available, check out a book at a specific library and return books. 
A librarian can update the number of copies of a book at their branch. 
The administrator can perform CRUD operations on data tables, such as updating table inforation, adding rows to tables and deleting rows.
